# TeenGuard: Drug Addiction Prediction Among Teenagers 🌿

Welcome to the visual showcase of TeenGuard, where data meets design in our quest to address drug addiction among teenagers. 🚀

## Overview 📝

At TeenGuard, we use machine learning to illuminate the patterns that underpin drug use. Our visuals are narratives that extend beyond the data, aiming to inform and catalyze interventions that can change lives.

## Best Performing Model 🏆

The **Random Forest algorithm with BorderlineSMOTE oversampling** emerged as the frontrunner, delivering an accuracy of 91%. It represents a beacon of hope, offering a reliable guide for impactful solutions.

## Visual Evidence 🖼

Embark on a visual journey through our models' performances:

- **Confusion Matrix**: The intricate dance of predicted versus actual values.
- **ROC Curve**: The elegant display of our model's diagnostic prowess.

These visual stories are organized within this directory:

- 🧬 `adasyn_oversampling/`: Insights from ADASYN-enhanced predictions.
- 🔍 `baseline_model/`: The starting point, without the influence of oversampling.
- 🎖 `borderline_oversampling/`: Showcasing our top-performing model.
- 🎲 `random_oversampling/`: Finding order in randomness.
- 🌪 `smote_oversampling/`: The narrative of SMOTE-enhanced data.

## Models and Techniques 🛠

We deployed a diverse array of algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

These were combined with sophisticated oversampling methods to achieve balanced and equitable predictive insights.

## Dataset 📊

The dataset, hailing from Kaggle, encompasses variables that provide a glimpse into the lives of teenagers and their predispositions to drug use. It's a mosaic of stories waiting to be told.
